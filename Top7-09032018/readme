How to use the Attention Layer:

1. Put the attention_layers_keras.py under the same folder of your main python script
2. Use "from attention_layers_keras import AttentionWeightedAverage" to import it
3. To call the Attention Layer just simply adds "AttentionWeightedAverage()" in the model (same as using max pooling layer)
